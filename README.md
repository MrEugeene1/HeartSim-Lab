# 🧪 HeartSim Lab: Create, Corrupt & Clean Your Own ECG Signal

**HeartSim Lab** is a simulation-based project where you generate your own synthetic heartbeat signal, add different types of real-world noise, and then clean it back up using signal processing techniques. It’s a great introduction to biomedical signal processing — without needing any actual ECG data!

## 🔍 What You’ll Learn

- 🎛 How to simulate a basic ECG waveform using sine waves  
- 🔌 How to model real-life noise:
  - Motion artifact (like when a person moves)
  - Powerline interference (from electrical systems)
  - Flicker noise (random low-frequency noise)  
- 🧼 How to clean the signal using a bandpass filter  
- 📈 How to visualize the clean vs noisy vs filtered signals
